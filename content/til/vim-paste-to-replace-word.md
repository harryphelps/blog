Type `v e p` to replace the current word with the one you have yanked, if your cursor is at the start of the word. Alternatively use `v i w p` to replace the word if your cursor is in the middle of it.

`v` enters visual mode,
`e` goes to the end of the word, or `i w` stands for inner word,
`p` to paste.

Nice.
